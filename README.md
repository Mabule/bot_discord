Hello and welcome in the "README.md" of the repository of my discord bot !

This bot was created to add fun to my servers, there are some cool commands like:
-The ping command which tells you how long it takes for the information to reach the server and come back to you
-The weather command wich tells you the weather of the city choosen, its related with the display command to adjust the precision and information of the weather
-The display command that allows to you to change the precision and the information given by the weather command 
(this command changes a variable between 1 and 2, this value is stored in a json file so it is not erased when the bot is shut down)
-The change activity command allows you to change the bot's current activity (and that can be really fun)
-The command of love that sends a beautiful message to the attention of the person mentioned
-The website command that sends an integration with your different websites (you must modify them because currently my sites in place ;) )
-And some other automated things like the message for a new arrival, or a command to know the identifier of a certain person
